<h2>Treasure Trails $guide Guide</h2>
<p>Riddles are primarily to test your Runescape knowledge. If you remember most of the stuff you learned through quests and other information, you shouldn't have a problem with these. However, since there's one or two things that might have slipped your mind, here's a list of the current riddles. They are in alphabetical order after the first letter in the riddle (example: "My name is..." is under M).
