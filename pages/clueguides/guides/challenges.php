<h2>$guide Treasure Trails Guide</h2>
<p>Challenges will not be in a clue scroll like all the other clues, they will be in challenge scrolls. When you get a challenge scroll you will need to figure out the answer, return to who ever gave you the challenge, and give him/her the answer. Currently, there are only very few challenges, here's a list:
