<br><br>
ANOTHER cooking apple respawn next to a jug and some grapes and a pot. Also, you put your grain here to and operate the hopper controls, then collect your flour from the flour bin (first floor).
<br><br>
The Cook's Guild is pretty close to Varrock's West Bank so if you need to train Cooking, it's the place to be.
