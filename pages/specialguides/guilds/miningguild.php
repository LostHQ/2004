Once you have reached lvl 60 mining (or 59 with dwarven stout), give yourself a pat on the back and say congratulations to yourself. You may now enter the mining guild!
<br><br>
Head East to the mining area where you will find the rocks. You have stumbled into one of the best mining places available! This area contains 5 mithril and 37 coal rocks. There are 42 rocks in total! Here is a map of what the mining guild looks like.

<br><br>
As you can see, there are many rocks, which are now very close together.
<br><br>
Also watch out for the random events, swarms can hurt you and are indestructable, also a rock golem can appear and attack you whilst mining, so be careful folks.
