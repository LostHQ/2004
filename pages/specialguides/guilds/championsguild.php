<br><br>
Here is an explanation on what is in the bottom floor:
<br><br>
To the left of the handsome man, the one with white hair, is the Guild Master who greets you when you enter the Champion's Guild. You can also talk to him about starting the Dragon Slayer Quest.
<br><br>
To the left of the Guild Master is a door, which leads to a smaller room that has a range in it.
<br><br>
To the left and behind the Guild Master are the stairs that will take you to the Upper Level.
<br><br>
The door at the bottom of the Picture (it is cut off) is where the Chicken Coop is - that is the main reason there is a range. So you can kill chickens then cook the meat and do whatever you want with the Cooked or Burnt meat.
<br><br>
To the Right of the handsome man is the door in which you can either Enter or Exit the Champion's Guild.
<br><br>
This is the Upper Level of the Champion's Guild. Here is an explanation of what is here:
<br><br>

<br><br>
Behind the handsome man is Scavvo, who sells Rune items and a few Dragon Hide items.
<br><br>
In the back of the Champion's Guild is camera shy Valaine (you can see how she tried to blend in with the Background). She sells a few different armours and you can sell your items to her.
<br><br>
This is Scavvo's Shop.
