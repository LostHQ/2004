The Mage Guild is situated in the centre of Yanille, south of Ardougne. Easiest way to get there without walking too much is to use Watchtower teleport (must have completed watchtower quest and must be level 58 magic). There is only one requirement to get in: must be level 66 magic, or level 63+ and drink Wizard's Mind Bomb beer right before getting in. The "bomb" can be bought at Falador's bar for 2gp.

Let's begin our tour of the guild at the lower floor, the basement. Here you can find caged zombies specifically designed for you to mage. There is a door that leads to where the zombies are. However you cannot open it. Hence if you are training there, I recommend u bring runes to cast telekinetic grab so you can get whatever drops you want from the other side.

Moving up to the ground level we find 2 level 9 mages, which can be attacked by you; Wizard Distentor, which teleports you to the Essence Mine, and lastly we find Zavistic Rarve. He is the person you talk to during the Zogres quest. He can also be found outside the guild if you ring the bell by the entrance.
