You can get a kitten by doing the <a href="?p=questguides&quest=gertrudescat">Gertrude's Cat Quest</a>.
<br><br>
There are a few colors of kittens, none of which are better or worse than any other.
<br><br>
So you want a certain kind of kitten? Well, you cannot directly pick your kitten, but there is a way to keep trying until you get the one you want. If you don't get it your first time talking to Gertrude, Right-click your kitten and select "Shoo cat". The kitten will run away. Then talk to Gertrude again and repeat until you get the specific kitten you wanted. (Bring about 1000 gp.) Or you can just be happy with what Gertrude gives you.<!-- Here are the kitten - overgrown cat pictures:

Once you have a kitten, you must take care of it, as you do in real life. The following are some care, food, and toy pointers.
<hr>
<h3>Care:</h3>
Your kitten won't grow if you keep it in your inventory or bank. If you want it to grow up, you need to Drop it so it can follow you, and spend lots of time with it. It usually takes about 2 to 5 hours of game play for it to turn into a Cat, and about the same time for it to become Overgrown, depending on how well you treat it. Once you drop your kitten/cat, there are quite a few things you can do with it:
<ul>
    <li>Pick up: You pick up your kitty and put it in your inventory</li>
    <li>Talk to: You talk to your pet and he/she says 'Miaow!' or 'Purr'.<!-- Your kitty has much more to say if you did Icthlarin's Little Helper quest and you have a Catspeak amulet --></li>
    <li>Interact with: There are several options when you click this:
    <ul>
        <li>Stroke: You pet your kitty</li>
        <li>Chase vermin: Your kitty chases the small rats (not the giant rats, of course!). Your kitten only has a 15% chance of getting the rat, however, a Cat is a much better hunter with a 70% chance of catching them</li>
        <li>Shoo away: You shoo away your kitty and it never comes back (but you can get a new one for 100 gp from Gertrude)</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Meals:</h3>
There are a few items you can use on your kitty like drinks and fish
<br><br>
<b>Fish:</b>
<br>
Kittens are picky. They don't like members fish and they don't like many cooked ones. Kittens eat:
<ul>
    <li>Both raw and cooked trout</li>
    <li>Both raw and cooked tuna</li>
    <li>Both raw and cooked sardines</li>
    <li>Only raw salmon</li>
    <li>Only raw anchovies</li>
    <li>Only raw shrimp</li>
</ul>
<b>Doogle leaves:</b>
<br>
To give your little furball a real treat, get some doogle leaves from behind Gertrude's house and use them on a sardine and feed the seasoned sardine to your kitty!
<br><br>
<b>Drinks:</b>
<br>
Kittens drink only milk.
<br>
Once your Kitten becomes a Cat, you don't need to feed it milk anymore.
<br><br>
<b>Toys:</b>
<br>
Ball of wool- Your little Kitten will have some real fun with this thing. Just Use the Ball of wool on the Kitten/Cat.
<br><br>
<b>Fishing at Catherby:</b>
<br><br>
Fishing at Catherby is a great place to raise your Kitten because you can fish for almost anything that you can feed it. MAKE SURE you leave at least ONE inventory slot open or your Kitten will run away after a minute or two.
<hr>
<h3>Quick Information</h3>
The following are just a few quick facts you might want to know about your pet:
<ul>
    <li>Your cat should no longer disappear and then reappear in your inventory. If this happens, it is just a graphical glitch</li>
    <li>Important: Do Not forget to feed your kitten. You will get 3 warnings before it runs away so pay attention!!</li>
    <li>You do NOT need to pick up your kitten/cat to go through gates and doors. Although it will stay behind, it will reappear next to you as soon as it goes off the edge of your minimap</li>
    <li>Important: If you neglect your Kitten, it will run away</li>
    <li>It can climb ladders and teleport with you (this includes Magic spells, Dueling Arena, Amulet of Glory, Ring of Life Teleports, Tree Spirits, and Gnome Gliders)</li>
    <li>If you get on a ship with your cat/kitten, it will reappear next to you once you reach your destination. Same thing for magic carpets</li>
    <li>Lagging: JaGeX has fixed the bad problem of disconnections while raising Cats, don't worry, if you lag, you won't lose your Cat</li>
    <li>PKing: If you are PKing or simply fighting a monster and you die, you will lose your Cat, period. Even if it is your most valuable object, you will still lose it. There is no way to keep the Kitten/Cat if you die in any way</li>
    <li>Keep an eye on where it is; though you can walk around trees and walls, your kitten can and will get caught behind the obstacles</li>
    <li>Your cat can die</li>
    <li>If you feed and take care of your Kitten correctly, it will become a Cat and you can sell it in West Ardougne for 100 Death runes</li>
</ul>
<b>Other:</b> 
<ul>
    <li>Your kitten should get hungry about every 25 minutes</li>
    <li>It is often handy to have your kitten out wherever you go, particularly when doing quests with a lot of walking involved. It is a good idea to have about 2 trout (or any other fish they eat) in your inventory whenever you are out with your kitten, as you never know when it will get hungry</li>
    <li>You only need to feed your kitten one type of food, you do not need to feed them a variety of different foods</li>
    <li>If your cat is on the ground when you log out, it will still be there when you log back in</li>
    <li>I have been told that overgrown cats of the same color are stackable</li>
    <li>Only one cat/kitten can follow you at a time</li>
</ul>
<b>Grown Cat</b>
<br><br>
Your kitten has grown! Now that your Kitten is a Cat, you can go to West Ardougne (Plague area) to sell it to a civilian (near the Underground Pass entrance) for 100 Death runes. Or you can go to Varrock Sewers and try to catch the level 1 rats to obtain a Cat Training Medal.
<br><br>
<b>Overgrown Cats</b>
<br><br>
After time, your cat will grow into a Overgrown cat. These cats no longer need your attention, and will no longer hunt Rats. You can get another Kitten from Gertrude while having an Overgrown cat. You can go to West Ardougne and sell your Overgrown cat for 100 Death runes, or you can keep it and have the pride of having a fully grown cat.

<h3>Cat Training Medal</h3>
<!-- cat training medal pic
<br><br> -->
This item has no effect when worn, and is purely cosmetic. If players lose or drop their training medal, they may talk to Gertrude to get another one. Kittens have a low chance of catching rats, so it is recommended to wait until your kitten has grown into a cat before you try to catch rats. <!-- (April 2005) To find out when your cat has caught 100 Rats, you need to have a Catspeak amulet and ask how he/she is. If your Cat says that he wants to go adventuring instead of saying that he/she wants to chase Rats, your cat has caught 100 Rats. This doesn't work with a Kitten; it has to be a Cat. --> 
<br><br>
<b>Varrock Sewers</b>
<br><br>
You will notice that there are tons of little level 1 Rats all over the ground, just right click on the cat and click Chase vermin. The Cat will try for the Rat and hopefully catch it. Instead of a 15% chance of success as a Kitten, there is now a 70% chance that your Cat will succeed. Once you catch 100 Rats, talk to Gertrude to get a Cat training medal. (Note that you might want to get a piece of paper out to write down every Rat your Cat catches.)
<br><br>
<!-- Doesn't exist until April 2005
The Catspeak Amulet
<br><br>

<br><br>
You can talk to your cat with the Catspeak amulet once you have completed Icthlarin's Little Helper Quest. The first time you talk to it with the Catspeak amulet, there will be a fifth option. If you choose to say that, you will see another flashback from the quest. The second time you talk to it with the Catspeak amulet, there will be another fifth option. Once you click on it, you and your kitten will talk for a bit and then there will be only four options when you talk to it. This is what you can routinely ask it:
<br><br>
ammy options pic
<br><br>
-How are you doing? Your kitten or cat will tell you how he/she is feeling. -How old are you now? Your kitten will say that he is young and doesnt want to grow into a cat at first, but then once he is close to becoming a cat, he will say he thinks he's getting quite old for a kitten. That's good news for you.
-Where do you want to go? Your pet tells you where it wants to go.
-What do you want to do now? Your pet tells you what it wants to do.
<br><br>
Also, if you bring your Kitten/Cat to Bob, the Jagex cat, while wearing your amulet, they will have some strange conversation...
