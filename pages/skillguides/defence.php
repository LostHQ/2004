<td>There are two types of helmet: full helms and medium helms. Full helms offer better protection than medium helms, but casting magic or using a ranged weapon is more difficult when using a full helm, since your vision is partially obstructed.</td>

<tr>
<td>Chainmail is made up of small rings connected together. It is particularly useful for deflecting slashing weapons and absorbing the impact of crush attacks. Chainmail is weak against stabbing weapons as small pointy blades can pierce the rings.  Chainmail is quite flexible and so does not cause any disadvantages while using ranged weapons. Mages will tend to find the armour gets slightly in the way of some of the finer spell casting techniques.</td>

<td>Plate armour is much heavier and stronger than chain. Rangers and mages find it incredibly difficult to use plate armour in conjunction with firing arrows or casting spells.<br><br>Plate armour is weakest against crushing damage as it cannot absorb the impact as well as it can absorb slashing or stabbing attacks.</td>

<td>Both varieties of shield feature excellent defences against slashing attacks. However, the kite shield is weak against stabbing attacks, and, the square shield is weak against crush attacks. Using the shield while casting magic or ranging is very difficult as it restricts the user's movement.<br><img style="display: inline;display: block; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20060702162501im_/http://www.runescape.com/img/kbase/armour/melee/crystalshield.gif" alt="[image]"><br>The crystal shield can only be used once you have completed the <a href="viewarticle.ws?article_id=1784">Roving Elves</a> quest and have 50 Agility. The crystal shield is especially good at defending ranged attacks, but provides little protection from magic. As the shield protects you from damage, it will weaken, until it eventually turns back into the crystal seed from which it was grown.</td>
