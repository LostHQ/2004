<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<br>
<div data-progress>Get 6 railings from the commander after agreeing to help him fix the fence to keep out those pesky goblins.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Walk along the fence, searching each section, and repair each broken fence. (These are not the same locations as in RS1.) Below is a map of where the broken fences are located.</div>

<br><br>
<div data-progress>After quite a while of searching &mdash; and praying you didn't miss one &mdash; go back and talk to the commander. He'll reveal that his watchtower, just south of the base, has stopped communications. Go and investigate.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Grab the dwarf remains in the tower (poor little guy), and walk back to the commander with the bad news...</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>After informing the commander, he'll say that the dwarf who was killed had a son, Gilob. Now it's time to track down the dwarf kid and his captors.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Head southeast around the Fishing Guild to a cave &mdash; it's right by the windmill to Ardougne. Enter and go northwest to the corner room.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Search the crate. The child will jump out, talk for a brief moment, and run back to the commander. Head back to the commander.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Upon your return, you learn that the base cannon needs fixing. Take the toolkit and go into the shed. Inspect each part until you finally fix all of them. You MAY fail MULTIPLE times.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Talk to the commander once again. He sends you to South Ice Mountain, to the dwarf base there, to get vital information about the cannons. These guys are real organized, aren't they?</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>A Falador teleport is really handy right here. Make your way to the Ice Mountain. In the west building is a dwarf named Nulodion. He'll give you the ammo mould and instructions that he forgot to send before.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>If you have the runes, teleport to Camelot. Once you get there by your chosen mode of transportation, return to the commander. Talk to him once more, and at long last, you receive your reward.</div>
