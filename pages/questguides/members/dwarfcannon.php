<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<br>
<div data-progress>Get 6 railings from the commander after agreeing to help him fix the fence to keep out those pesky goblins.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Walk along the fence, searching each section. (These are not the same locations as in RS1.) After quite a while of searching — and praying you didn't miss one — go back and talk to the commander.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>He'll reveal that his watchtower, just south of the base, has stopped communications. Go and investigate. Grab the dwarf remains in the tower (poor little guy), and walk back to the commander with the bad news...</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>After informing the commander, he'll say that the dwarf who was killed had a son, Gilob. Now it's time to track down the dwarf kid and his captors.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Head southeast around the Fishing Guild to a cave — it's right by the windmill to Ardougne. Enter and go to the corner room opposite the entrance. Search in the crates (it's one of the different-colored ones, I'm pretty sure). The child will jump out, talk for a brief moment, and run back to the commander. Head there also.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Upon your return, you learn that the base cannon needs fixing. Take the toolkit and go into the shed. Inspect each part until you finally fix all of them. You WILL fail MULTIPLE times.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Talk to the commander once again. He sends you to South Ice Mountain, to the dwarf base there, to get vital information about the cannons. These guys are real organized, aren't they? A Falador teleport is really handy right here. In one of the buildings is a dwarf — the only one that has a name. He'll give you the ammo mould and instructions that he forgot to send before.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Teleport to Camelot, or nearby if you have the runes. For you pures out there… you're just outta luck today. Once you get there by your chosen mode of transportation, talk once more to the commander, and at long last, you receive your reward.</div>
