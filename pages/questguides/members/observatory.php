Description:Help a professor fix his telescope, this proves more difficult than it sounds because it involves yet another maze. See what the stars have in hold for you as well.<br>
<br>
<b>Difficulty Level: <font color="Yellow">Medium</font></b><br>
<br>
Items/Skills Needed To Start: A bronze bar, molten glass, 3 planks, 10 crafting, a cure poison potion is recommened.<br>
<br>
Starting Location: West across the river from the gnome maze, just next to the small goblin town.<br>
<br>
Reward: 3250 crafting xp, a jug of wine, a random reward depending on what constellation you see and a book on astrology (no good use).<br>
<br>
<b>Instructions:</b><br>
<br>
Talk to the professor in the square building north of the observatory. He explains that the pesky goblins next door (Don't you just hate the rude next neighbors?) have broken his telescope and he needs parts to fix it. He suggests talking to his assistant, but if you have the items needed already you don't have to for a minute.<br>
<br>
After giving all the items to him, he'll say that he needs a lens to craft the glass. Go find it in the dungeon down the ladder. All you have to do is take the south way, then once you see the most southeastern room, click in it and the auto pathfinding will take you to it. Open the chest upon your arrival and search it for a keep key. (Any other chest you open contains a poison spider! There is a cure poison in the observatory ladder.<br>
<br>
Head back the way you came in, it shouldn't be that difficult. Don't leave your computer by auto pathfinding though, because you have to make another stop on the way out. When you see a little room with a bed sign in it (High-resolution required to see) go to it and kill the level 42 goblin guard.<br>
<br>
Go in quickly and search the west sacks to discover the mould. Go out of the keep and head generally east until you come back to the ladder.<br>
<br>
The professor will give you a lame excuse that he can't make the lens because his crafting level isn't high enough (pathetic wimp). Use your superior skills and make it for him. Then talk to him again.<br>
<br>
Now go back into the dungeon to meet the professor in the observatory.<br>
<br>
Go a little south and you should see 3 dead end passages in a row on the map. Click on the most south one to auto pathfind again. Go up the ladder when you get there<br>
<br>
Look through the telescope to see a constellation, your prize depending on what you see is RANDOM, which is very unfourtanate if you get something like 3 cooked tunas... uh hum, me. See the complete list of rewards below. You will automatically talk to the professor and finish the quest.<br>
<br>
Once you find your way out, get some wine from the assistant for fun, and visit the zamorak worship site to the northeast and as a special bonus to those who have completed the quest, you can get an unholy zamorak symbol mould from the Spirit of Scorpious. (Congratulations, I now officially say you are done) Here are the possible rewards: Aries: Attack experience Capricorn: Strength experience Virgo: Defense experience Cancer: Emerald Amulet of Protection Taurus: Super Strength Potion Leo: Hits experience Sagittarius: Maple Longbow Pisces: 3 Cooked Tunas and an uncut sapphire Gemini: Black 2-Handed Sword , uncut sapphire Scorpio: Weapon Poison Aquarius: 25 Water Runes Libra: 3 Law Runes<br>
