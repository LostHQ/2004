<br><br>
<div data-progress>Go to the 3rd floor and talk to Drezel through cell door. Ask him to tell you about the Holy River. He will tell you how Sardomin made the river unpassable to all who were evil. He says that the river may not protect them again and asks you to help make it protect the lands again. He will tell you to get him out of the cell, incapacitate the vampire, and help fix the holy river.</div>

<div data-progress>Go back to the Cell and use the iron key on the cell door, then go in the cell and talk to Drezel. He will tell you that he cannot leave with the vampire still there, and tells you that the water of the river might be able to incapictate the vampire.</div>

<br><br>
<div data-progress>Go back to the monuments and go through the north-east gate. You will find Drezel there. Talk to him. He will tell you that the river has been unblessed. You suggest using rune essence to remove the Zamoraken magic. He tells you it will take 50 rune essence to do it. If you brought the unnoted essence, talk to him again and give it to him.</div>
<br><br>
Note: You MUST bring unnoted essence or he will not accept it.
