<h2>2004HQ - $questName</h2>
<br>
Starting Location: East Ardougne Speak to: King Lathas<br>
<br>
<b>Difficulty Level: <font color="Orange">Medium/Long</font></b><br>
<br>
<b>Length: <font color="Red">Long</font></b><br>
<br>
Minimum requirements: Level 25 Ranged, must defeat three level 91 demons, must have completed the Biohazard quest, and good Thieving and Agility are an advantage. Level 25 Agility is recommended, though.<br>
<br>
Items needed: Bow, arrows, spade, rope (maybe two if you want to save a tiny bit of time), armour, weapon, and food (Note: you might want to take a bow and arrows, that you do not mind dropping. After certain points you will not need them again, and inventory space can get pretty low.)<br>
If your thieving is below level 50 you will probably have a harder time with this quest. You will need as much food that heals the most hit points as you can carry.<br>
<br>
Reward: 5 Quest Points, Agility exp (amount depends on your level), Staff of Iban, 15 Death Runes, 30 Fire Runes, and the ability to use Iban Blast.<br>
<br>
1. Start by talking to King Lathas, who is on the <span data-floors="US">2nd floor</span> of the Paladin Tower in Ardougne, he will tell you about the quest and tells you to talk to one of his scouts.<br>
<br>
2. Head to west Ardournge and go as west as you can go and you should find Koftik, talk to him and then enter the cave near him.<br>
<br>
3. Now there are two choices: if you brought two ropes, you can use one on a stalactite, or you can take the Agility route by climbing over the rockslides. I recommend climbing the rockslides.<br>
<br>
4. On the other side of the swamp, you'll meet Koftik again, talk to him and you get a damp cloth use it on the arrows you took to get a fire arrow, talk to him again to get another damp cloth and wrap it around the other arrows, repeat until you have round about 10 fire arrows. Use these arrows on the fire near by to set them alight.<br>

<br>
5. Now, go around the cliff to the north and you should be behind a fence, try shooting at the guide ropes that hold the bridge up. When you hit it you are automatically taken across it. Positioning is critical when shooting at the ropes, you should stand at the center of the fence's length.<br>
<br>
6. Now head north and pick up the plank that is guarded by blessed spiders then head south and follow the path.<br>
<br>
7. You should find a gap with a pole shaped rock above it, use your rope on the rock to get across. Follow the path and go down the small alley climbing over a rockslide. After you climb it there should be another to the west that you should climb as well.<br>
<br>
8. Now you should find Koftik, talk to him and you will find that he is slowly being possessed.<br>
<br>
9. Here is the grid. The right order to successfully cross is...<br>
first row. 1 spot from north<br>
second row. 2 spot from north<br>
third row. 2 spot from north<br>
4th row. 2 stop from north<br>
5th row. 2 spot from north<br>
find the block you can stand on in the first row<br>
>then try path 1, 2, or 3.<br>
>Once you find one of those that work, (path 3 in the example) try again path's 1, 2, or 3.<br>
>Continue this process until you find a safe path across if you fall climb back up on protruding rocks or you will continue to receive hits<br>
<br>

<br>
10. Once across pull the lever and the portcullis should open, you automatically walk through. Follow the path to were the zombies are and either run through the west alley if you are not at all good at thieving, or if you are try to search the odd markings on the west alley and disarm the traps.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\underground3.jpg" height="350" width="350"><br>
<br>
11. When you are across all the traps there should be a well in the middle of the room. This part is quite easy, go up the north road and notice there are flat rocks on the floor, use the plank on the flat rocks to cross until you get to the the orb of light. Pick it up, then return to the well.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\underground4.jpg" height="350" width="350"><br>
<br>
12. Run across the northwest path trying not to get hit by the enemies, pick up the orb of light and return to the well.<br>
<br>
13. The west path is the same as the north path, just use your plank on the flat rocks pick the orb of light up and return to the well.<br>
<br>
14. This is the easiest path, the south west path, search the flat stone under the orb. When you try to pick it up, you’ll be asked whether you want to disarm it. If you fail, you will be damaged by a swinging log. If you succeed return back to the well.<br>
<br>
15. Now either run across the path with the strange markings or search the odd markings and disarm the traps to return to the room with the zombies. Use all the orbs with the furnace and go back across to the room with the well, either by disarming the traps or running through.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\underground5.jpg" height="350" width="350"><br>
<br>
16. Climb down the well and search the crates nearby, one will contain some food. Now run across the path to get to some cages. Pick the lock on the cage to the southeast, then use the spade on the mud to get through a tunnel.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\underground6.jpg" height="350" width="350"><br>
<br>
17. Head west and cross the ledge to reach another difficult part. If you are a level 50+ thief then pick lock the gate and then the other gate or, if you're not good at Thieving like me, you’ll need to cross the stone bridges to get to the other end.<br>
<br>

<br>
18. Follow the path south and go through the obstacle pipe.<br>
<br>
19. Search the Unicorn Cage for a railing. Go around to where the boulder is.<br>
<br>
20. Use the Railing Pipe to move the boulder. Go back to the unicorn cage and search it for the unicorn horn.<br>
<br>
21. Now enter the tunnel nearby.<br>
<br>
22. Continue down the path past Zombies.<br>
<br>
23. Talk to Carl the Paladin, he gives you food and a prayer potion. Then slaughter all of the paladins for Crests.<br>
<br>
24. Continue down the path and use the plank on the flat rock to disarm it.<br>
<br>
25. Use the Unicorn Horn and Crests on the well type thing and go through the door. (Note this is the well you use your iban staff on to recharge it once you hae finished the quest and have used all the charges)<br>
<br>
26. Before doing any of this you should go down to the south entrance and talk to the dwarf which will tell you about the witch. only after talking with the dwarfs until they mention a witch that is friends with iban, you can pick up the cat when you see the witch searching for it through the window. IF YOU DON'T DO THIS YOU CAN'T PICK UP THE CAT!<br>
In this area, go to the south along the east wall until you get to the south wall then head back up the east wall until you get to a bridge thing, cross it then go to the hut to the south and search the window. The witch is looking for her cat, to find it follow this pattern north, west, north, west etc etc… until you find the cat, then go back to the witches hut, use the cat on the door or knock on the door, I can't remember which, while she is playing with the cat, open the door, and search the chest inside.<br>
<br>
27. Go back to where you found the cat, then go west and south to the demons. Head to the southwest of the huge, maze-like area. Kill the three special demons—it might take a while to find them—and collect their amulets. Open the nearby Chest for the Soul of Iban. Smear it on the Doll.<br>
<br>
28. When you go back to dwarves or if you fall your at the dwarves, you should end in a HUGE open area. Go to the southwest for some Dwarves. After you've got the Witch's items, talk to all the dwarfs, Klank will give you Klank's Gauntlets and a tinderbox. Take the Bucket. Empty the single indoor barrel in the house for Dwarf Brew.<br>
<br>
29. Go east in this area to reach Iban's tomb. Use the Dwarf Brew on it, then set it on fire with a tinderbox. Take Iban's flesh and smear it on the Doll. *You can now drop your Tinderbox*<br>
<br>
30. Head to the northeast. To where all the spiders are. Kill the huge spider to get blood. Smear it on the doll.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\underground8.jpg" height="350" width="350"><br>
<br>
31. Go upstairs (stairs are to the northwest and south).<br>
<br>
32. Go all the way northwest of the Maze. Wear Klank's Gauntlets, and Search Cages. The soulless will bite you, but will fail because you're wearing nice Gauntlets =) The cage that contains the dove is very hard to find but keep at it and you should find it.<br>
Note: When looking for the dove, remember there are two cage sections—one in the northwestern corner and another slightly farther south.<br>
<br>
33. Now for the Final Battle. Head to the middle of the maze, kill some Iban Disciples for Zamorak Robes, wear them, and go inside. Before entering the temple, make sure you have two or three empty inventory slots. In order to enter the temple you cannot have anything in your weapon inventory except for the Robe of Zamorak. If you need food Klank will sell some to you.<br>
<br>
34. Iban will see you have the only weapon to destroy him, the complete Doll. He will blast spells at you! Which are monster legs coming up from the floor in my opinion. Make sure that you have 3 empty spots of inventory.<br>
<br>
35. Run towards him, hopefully dodging the shots, and throw the Doll into the Well. Iban will die. Stay there after throwing the doll; it will take a little while for the blasts to stop.<br>
<br>
36. You will be flung into an underground area. Talk to the helper again and he'll take you outside.<br>
