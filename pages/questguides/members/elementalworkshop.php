Search the bookcase on the east wall.<br>

<br>
After you read the Battered Book, use your knife on the book and you will get a Battered Key. Do not drop the Battered Book — you will need it later to make the Elemental Shield.<br>
<br>
Go to the building north, which has an anvil in it, and use the key on the Odd Looking Wall. Then go down the stairs.<br>

<br>
When you're in, go down the west path and try to mine a rock. You will be attacked by a level 35 Earth Elemental. Kill the Earth Elemental, and it will drop an Elemental Ore — pick it up.<br>

<br>
Now go to the north passage from where you came in. Turn the valves so they are like this: First, you need to turn the right valve, then the left valve, to make the waterwheel move. Then pull the lever. (The right valve is the first, and the second is the left valve.)<br>
<br>

<br>
After that, go to the east passage and fix the bellows. This is where the leather, thread, and needle come in.<br>

<br>
After that, search all the crates for a Stone Bowl (you only need to search each crate once). The location is different for each player. When you find it, go down the south passage.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\elemental9.png" height="200" width="350"><br>
<br>
Use the bowl on the lava, and you will get a Stone Bowl filled with lava. Then use the bowl with lava in it on the furnace.<br>
<br>

<br>
Go back to the bellows and pull the switch.<br>
<br>
Go back to the furnace and use your Elemental Ore and 4 Coal on the furnace.<br>
<br>

<br>
Then go back to the center and use your Elemental Metal on the workbench. You will need to have the Battered Book in your inventory to make the shield, or it will tell you that you need instructions.<br>
<br>
When you've made the Elemental Shield, you've completed the quest.<br>
Note: You can make more Elemental Shields after you've finished the quest.<br>
