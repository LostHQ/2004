<b>Instructions:</b><br>
<br>
Talk to the King at the Grand Tree, which is in the northern area of the Gnome Stronghold; he will give you a translation book and a bark sample.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\grandtree1.png" height="280" width="400"><br>
<br>
Take these to Hazelmere; he is south of Ardougne and east of Yanille, on a spit of land near the town with the Fight Arena and Magic Guild.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\grandtree2.png" height="350" width="400"><br>
<br>
There are Jungle Spiders on this peninsula. The house is on top of a hill. Enter and go up the ladder.<br>
Then talk to Hazelmere; he will take the sample and show you a message.<br>
The message when translated using your book says:<br>
“A man came to me with the King seal<br>
I gave human Daconia rock<br>
and Daconia rocks will kill trees"<br>
* I have given a direct translation. *<br>
Go back to the King at Grand Tree, talk to him, and select the message as above (you will have to select 'none of the above' 3 times before the correct selection appears).<br>
<br>
Go to Glough (in the tree south and slightly southeast of the path), talk to him, and he says he will take care of it. Then return to the King.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\grandtree3.png" height="300" width="400"><br>
<br>
The King tells you that they have already caught someone; you ask to see the prisoner. The King gives you permission and tells you that the prisoner is at the top of the tree.<br>
<br>
Charlie, the prisoner, tells you to search Glough's home.<br>
<br>
Go back to Glough, search the cupboard; you will find a journal. (There is also a chest; you will get the key to this a little later in the quest).<br>
<br>
Take the journal back to the King, and tell him of your suspicions. The King dismisses your ideas and sends you back to talk to Glough.<br>
<br>
Talk to Glough once again... you accuse him, and he has you arrested and imprisoned next to Charlie at the top of the tree.<br>
<br>
Whilst in prison Charlie tells you about warships being built on Karamja. He tells you a password to tell to the foreman of the shipyard.<br>
<br>
The King lets you out of prison. You can now use the glider to travel to Karamja to find the foreman (note: Jungle Spiders and Jogres roam this area).<br>
<br>
Try to open the gate; the shipyard worker (level 44) will ask for a password. Select the three choices:<br>
<br>
ka<br>
lu<br>
min<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\grandtree4.png" height="300" width="400"><br>
<br>
Talk to the foreman; he will ask 3 questions to make sure you've come from Glough.<br>
1. How is Glough's wife? (She is no longer with us)<br>
2. What's Glough's favourite food? (Wormhole)<br>
3. What is his new girlfriend called? (Anita)<br>
(If you get the answers wrong he will attack you and you will have to start again with a new foreman!)<br>
After this, you will receive a note for Glough about the ship. Take this back to the King.<br>
<br>
You can't return by the glider, as it was broken when you landed. If you try to walk back the guards won't let you back in as they think you are a spy. Instead go to 'Gnome Maze Village' and transport back in using the spirit tree.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\grandtree5.png" height="300" width="400"><br>
<img src="img\questimages\grandtree6.png" height="300" width="400"><br>
<br>
The King yet again refuses to believe your accusations against Glough.<br>
Go and talk to Charlie at the top of the tree again.<br>
<br>
Charlie suggests that you talk to Glough's girlfriend, Anita, as she might be able to help you. Anita lives near the swamp, northwest of the Grand Tree.<br>
<br>
Talk to Anita and she will ask you to return a key to Glough. This is the key to the chest you've been waiting to open!<br>
<br>
Open the chest in Glough's house to find some notes about his plan to take over RuneScape.<br>
<br>
Take this evidence to the King. Once again, he doesn't believe you but he says that they have searched Glough's house and all they found was four sticks. The King gives you the sticks. They spell "T-U-Z-O."<br>
<br>
If you check with your translation book you will find that, if rearranged, the sticks will spell the word 'open'.<br>
<br>
For the whole list of translations go to the bottom of this guide<br>
<br>
Go to Glough's house and go up to the watchtower (this is why you need level 25 agility to complete quest).<br>
<br>
Place the sticks on the stand in the following order (use the sticks with the stand):<br>
'T' in the far left position<br>
'U' in center left position<br>
'Z' in center right<br>
'O' in the far right<br>
<br>
Once you have done this, open the stone stand...be warned before you do this…<br>
After you drop down, a Black Demon (level 172) attacks you. So be sure to go with plenty of prayer to paralyze or food!<br>
<br>

<img src="img\questimages\grandtree8.png" height="300" width="400"><br>
<br>
Range Option:<br>
There are mithril rocks west of the ladder. Make sure you lure the demon out first, then run over to the rocks. If the demon can still attack you, go farther in. Bring food in case you get hit.<br>
<br>
You have a brief conversation with Glough, and then a Black Demon appears and attacks you (The map will zoom out and start to shake). Once you have killed it, follow the passageway until you see the King. Talk to him and he will express concern that you are hurt. At this point you once again accuse Glough.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\grandtree9.png" height="400" width="400"><br>
<br>
He sends guards to check out your story. Once proven, he asks you to help one last time and find the final Daconia Stone. Search all the roots in the area until you find a small blue rock.<br>
<br>
Once you find it return to King and he will reward you. You will also be able to use the glider, and there is now a mine open beneath the tree, accessible by pushing some roots. To access this mine in the future, enter the Grand Tree and move the tile in the floor.<br>
