  <p><u>Instructions:</u></p>
  <ol>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Talk to the Archeological expert. He tells you
      to bring anything you find to him. Inquire about exams to Examiner. She
      gives you an unstamped certificate of recommendation.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Go to the Varrock Museum. Use the unstamped
      certificate of recommendation on the Curator. He will stamp the certificate
      so you can begin the certification exams. Go to clothes shop next to the
      general store and buy boots and gloves if you don't already
      have them; put them on! Also if you don't already have a cup of tea, on your
      way out of Varrock, buy a cup of tea from the new tea salesman next to the
      East gate.  You can also thieve a cup of tea.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Go back to the Examiner and give her the stamped
      certificate of recommendation. Follow the main road north until you come to
      two wooden walkways. Take the northeast one to the top of the hill. Next to
      the large urn are two bushes. Search the one to the east for a rock sample.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Continue following the walkway to the bottom of
      the hill. Take the panning tray from inside the large tent.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Go southeast from the tent to the stream and use
      the panning tray on the panning points. A guide will ask you what you are
      doing and then tell you that you cannot pan the stream unless you're invited.
      Ask him how to get invited, he tells you if you do him a favor and get him
      some tea he will look the other way. Use the cup of tea on the guide to
      be allowed to pan. Once you pan the stream you must search the panning tray
      to see what you found. Pan until you get a rock sample covered with mud and
      2 opals if you didn't bring cut opals with you (you may need more than two
      opals if cutting them fails).<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Go Northwest of the panning points to the dig
      area and pickpocket the workman until you get a rock sample and 3 ropes
      (unless you brought the ropes with you already) and a specimen brush.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Talk to a student in a green shirt, just north
      of the workman...he will take rock sample 1 and give you the following
      exam answer: the study of earth sciences is the study of the earth, its
      contents and history. A bit north, talk to a male student in an orange shirt.
      He will take rock sample 2 and give this answer: the eligible people to use
      the digsite are all that have passed the appropriate earth sciences exam.
      Just a bit north of here, talk to a female student in a purple shirt. She
      will take rock sample 3 and give this answer: the proper health and safety
      points are gloves and boots to be worn at all times, proper tools must be
      used.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Go back to the Examiner and take the exam. She
      will give you a level one certificate and a trowel for completing the first
      of 3 exams. Do not lose the trowel, because at this time, once you complete
      all 3 exams, you cannot get another one from her, you can however pickpocket
      a workman for one. You can take the certificate to the Curator at the
      museum for safekeeping or you can hold onto it until you get all three and
      then take them to him.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Go speak to the students again to get the answers
      to the second exam. The green shirt student tells you correct rockpick usage:
      always handle with care, strike the rock cleanly on its cleaving point. The
      orange shirt student tells of correct sample transportation: samples taken
      in rough form, kept only in sealed containers. The purple shirt student
      explains finds handling: finds must be carefully handled, and gloves worn...
      You will get a certificate for completing the 2nd exam. You can take the
      certificate to the curator at the museum for safekeeping or you can hold
      onto it until you get all three and then take them to him.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Go speak to the students again to get the answers
      to the third exam. The female student will ask for an opal in exchange for her help.
      Specimen brush use: brush carefully and slowly using short strokes. Proper technique
      for handling bones: handle bones carefully, and keep away from other samples.
      Sample preparation: samples cleaned and carried only in specimen jars. Take her
      answer and the guy's answers and go to the Examiner and take the third exam.
      You will get a certificate for completing the 3rd exam. You now have graduated
      and can dig anywhere in the dig site. Take your certificate to the curator
      in the Varrock museum and you either get a Chocolate Cake or Fruit Blast as a
      reward for graduating. <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Go back to the Dig site go to the north east corner
      of the dig site (past a winch that you will use later) to the level 3 area
      with the buried skeleton. Search the sacks and find the specimen jar.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Go to the north east corner to the level 3 area
      with the buried skeleton and use the trowel on the soil until you find a
      Zamos Talisman. Next use the Talisman on the Archeological expert (by the
      Examiner); he will reward you for your keen eye with a scroll saying you
      can use his personal mine shaft (which is the winch next to the area you
      got the Talisman from).<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Return to the digsite and use the letter with a
      workman. He will allow you to enter the shafts. Go to the northwest corner,
      then go south one level (sign reads lvl 2 digs only) to the site with the winch.
      Operate the winch and you'll be told you need something to help the bucket
      reach the bottom. Use the rope with the winch and operate it to lower yourself
      to the bottom. Take an Arcenia root and climb back to the surface.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Go back to the tents. Search the specimen tray 
      outside of the tent where you found the panning tray until you find charcoal.
      Use pestle and mortar on the charcoal to get another ingredient for the bomb.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Go west of the tent where you got the panning
      tray; you will find 3 barrels.  Use the trowel on them until one of them
      is opened. Use the vial on the open barrel to get an orange unidentified
      liquid. <font color="#FF0000">Do not, I repeat, do not drop
      the vial! You will take from 20 to 36 damage!</font><br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Take vial and use it on Archeological expert (by the
      Examiner) to get it identified as Nitroglycerin.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Search the bookshelves in the Examiner's room and
      find the Book of Experimental Chemistry. Read this book. It has the ingredients
      to make a bomb you will need later on. Search the cupboard to find the Rock
      pick (Rock pick is not needed to complete the quest).<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Go back to the dig site to the northeast winch; the
      guy tells you that it's a private winch. Use the scroll on him to be able
      to go down. Operate the winch. Use rope on the winch, then operate it again
      to go down. Talk to the Workmen and say the following things: I have been
      invited to work here, then, do you know where I can find a chest key then
      from then on use the first option in every sentence to beg yourself a new
      key.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Go to the tent where you got the panning tray.
      Use the key on chest and you'll receive an unidentified white chemical powder.
      Take the unidentified powder to the Archeological expert to get it identified
      as ammonium nitrate. <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Go back to the dig site and go back down the north
      west winch. Prepare yourself an explosive compound: <br>
      <br>
      <input type="checkbox"> Use the ammonium nitrate on nitroglycerin,<br>
      <input type="checkbox"> Use ground charcoal on the mixture,<br>
      <input type="checkbox"> Finally use the Arcenia root on the mixture.<br>
      <br>
      <input type="checkbox"> You now have an explosive compound.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Go to the south fork and use the explosive compound
      on the bricks blocking the way. Then light the brick with your tinderbox.
      Once the path has been cleared, go straight ahead and get the stone tablet
      in the middle of the room.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox"> Take the stone tablet back to the Archeological
      expert to complete the quest and get your reward. </li>
