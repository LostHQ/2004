<b>Instructions:</b><br>

Talk to Brother Kojo; he should be in the clock tower just southwest of Ardougne Zoo.<br>
<br>
You need to get all four cogs. Remember, you can only carry one at a time.<br>
<br>
Go down the ladder, and you should be in a dungeon. In the next room, you will see colored blocks on the floor representing the general direction of each cog.<br>
<br>
Black Cog:<br>
<br>
Use the colored block to see where to go. Go down the path to a door. Behind the door, you will see level 2 giant spiders and the black cog surrounded by fires.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Use the bucket of water or wear your ice gloves and pick it up. Now go back up the ladder to the <span data-floors="US">1st floor</span>.<br>
<br>
On the <span data-floors="US">1st floor</span>, use your black cog on the black pole.<br>
<br>
Red Cog:<br>
<br>
Go to the colored bricks in the next room and go through the door. The red brick represents southeast.<br>
<br>
Go through the door, and you'll reach a room with three level 53 ogres and the red cog.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Go back to the ladder, go up to the <span data-floors="US">2nd floor</span>, and use the red cog on the red pole.<br>
<br>
White Cog:<br>
<br>
Go down the ladder to the dungeon and go to the room with the colored bricks. Now go through the door where the white brick represents northwest.<br>
<br>
Continue going northwest to get the rat poison. After you've picked it up, go east to the rat cage.<br>
<br>
At the rat cage, you will see two levers to open the two doors. Pull the levers to get into the cage.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Inside the cage, you will see the rats' food trough. Use the rat poison on it, and the rats will eat from it and die. Then the room with the white cog will open.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Pick up the white cog, go up the ladder, and you will appear outside the clock tower. Go inside and use the white cog on the white pole near the ladder, on the <span data-floors="US">3rd floor</span>.<br>
<br>
Blue Cog:<br>
<br>
Go down to the dungeon and to the room with the colored bricks. Go through the door where the blue brick represents southwest.<br>
<br>
After going in, you'll reach a room with some monsters locked in cages, but unfortunately, the blue cog is locked in as well, with no doors. So you'll need to find another entrance to the blue cog.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Go up the ladder in the room, and you will appear outside the clock tower. Now go northeast to where Brother Cedric is. Just west of him is a ladder.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\clocktower6.png" height="200" width="200"><br>
<br>
<br>
Go down the ladder and follow the passage to a wall. Go through the door and pick up the blue cog. Go up the ladder, go inside the clock tower, up the staircase to the <span data-floors="US">2nd floor</span>, and use the blue cog on the blue pole.<br>
<br>
Now that all of the cogs have been placed, talk to Brother Kojo to receive your reward.<br>
