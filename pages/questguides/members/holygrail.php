<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<br>
<div data-progress>Talk to King Arthur in the Castle in Camelot. He will tell you that he wants you to go on a quest to retrieve the Holy Grail and that for more details you should talk to Merlin.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Go up the stairs, enter the lab, and talk to Merlin. He will tell you about Sir Galahad who lives west of McGrubor's woods.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Go to Brother Galahad, who lives in a house directly west of McGrubor's Woods. Talk to him. He will tell you about how he once found the Grail by accident but it didn't feel right to take the Grail from its home so he left it there.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Now you must go to Port Sarim and take a boat ride to Entrana Island; make sure you don't have any weapons or armor with you.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Once you are on Entrana go to the church and talk to the High Priest. Tell him that you are interested in finding the Holy Grail. The Crone will interrupt and start talking to you about the Fisher King. She will tell you that the Fisher King is in pain and you must blow the whistle where all six heads point to. Also ask her about the whistle and how to obtain it.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Now go back to Brother Galahad. Talk to him and try to get him to give you an item. He will give you a Holy Table Napkin.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Go to Draynor Manor, located directly north of Draynor Village. Go to the top floor and go to the room all the way south. You must have the napkin in your inventory, or you will not be able to see the Magic Whistle. Pick up two Magic Whistles as you will need a second later on in the quest.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Now, you must prepare to fight the level 126 Black Knight Titan. You should have a prayer level of 43 so you can use protect from melee. You must bring along your Excalibur from the Merlin's Crystal quest. If you do not have it for any reason, you will need to get another by talking to the Lady of the Lake. You will need this to finish off the knight.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Once you are done preparing you must go to Brimhaven. Once you are there, head all the way west until you reach the poison scorpions. Once you get to the poison scorpions, head toward the north. Past the horseshoe-shaped cluster of gold ore rocks is a platform on stilts. Simply stand under it and blow the whistle.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Now it's time to defeat the Black Knight Titan. Head west, talk to the knight, and then engage in combat. This is the hardest part of the whole quest.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Now head towards the small peninsula. Once you cross the bridge, the fisherman is just to the southeast. Talk to the fisherman and ask how to get inside the nearby castle. He will tell you to pick up one of the bells and ring it.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Go west of the fisherman and you will see the castle. A Grail Bell is lying outside the wall to the northwest. Ring it and a Grail Maiden will bring you into the castle.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Climb the central staircase and go to the eastern room to speak with the Fisher King.He asks you to find his son, Percival — a Knight of the Round Table — and return him to his father's castle.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Now you must go to Camelot (blow the whistle to get out of the castle).</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Once you are in Camelot, talk to King Arthur and ask him about the Fisher King's son Percival. He will give you a magical feather that will guide you to the place you want to go.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>To speed things up, go to Goblin Village and enter the hut on the far right (east). Right click on the sacks and prod them and then right click to open them. Sir Percival will escape and talk to you, taking the spare whistle to use to re-enter his father's castle.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Return to the Fisher King's Castle. You will notice the countryside is green and flourishing again, and the Black Knight Titan is gone. Enter the castle through the door and go up the central staircase to find that Percival is now king. Talk to him to receive his thanks.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Go back down the central staircase and make your way to the eastern tower. Climb the staircase, then the ladder. Take the Holy Grail.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Return to Camelot and speak with King Arthur to receive your reward.</div>
