<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<br>
<div data-progress>Find Elkoy near the northwest corner of the maze. He invites you to try the maze. Once you conquer it, talk to King Bolren. He'll ask you to help their cause by retrieving 1 of 3 orbs of protection. Agree and you'll be led to battlefield.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Talk to Commander Montai to get the latest update with the battle. He'll ask for 6 loads of wood to repair defenses. Assuming you have your 6 logs with you, talk to him again. He will thank you. Speak to him once more, and he'll ask you to find the coordinates from his trackers to fire the ballista at the Khazard stronghold.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Head north to find the first tracker. He's in an oblong building in the northeast part of the Khazard camp. You'll learn that the Y-coordinate is 5.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Head west, above the long building. The second gnome should be just along the wall. You'll find that the height coordinate is 4.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Head south on the outskirts of the camp to find the 3rd tracker. He's a little "off" and gives you a strange riddle to decipher the X-coordinate. Luckily, I'm a master riddler and figured it out.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>"More than me" — Higher than 1, "Less than our feet" — Less than 4, "More than we" — More than 2, and "Khazard's men are beat" — This obviously refers to me as beating the men, NOT, well anyway he means 3 because thats the only number left. Return to the Gnome camp.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Go directly to the ballista and use the coordinates you have learned.<br>
Height=4 X=3 Y=5</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Assuming you entered these in right, go the main building and climb over the wall. It's the northwest building. Be prepared to get rid of a level 48 Khazard commander, one downstairs and one up.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Upon their defeat, open the chest on the <span data-floors="US">2nd floor</span> to get the orb. Return to Elkoy at the maze entrance and he'll lead you back in.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Speak to Bolren again. He is briefly thankful for your return, but you'll find that his family has been killed, and the other two orbs were taken by Khazard's troops. Elkoy will guide you out, go north past the Khazard camp, then northwest and past level 64 wolves to face the Warlord who holds the orbs.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Run past his guards and attack him. You should have food, which you should run and eat if your health gets low. Ranging and maging work well on him, since he cannot leave a certain zone. Weaken him until you run out or he's fairly weak, then charge him and kill him.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Once he is dead (congratulations!), you'll receive the orbs. Return once again to Elkoy, then to Bolren. He'll tell you about the Spirit Trees and give you your reward.</div>
