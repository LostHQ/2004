Description: The Servil family has been broken up by the evil General Khazard. Reunite the family and ultimately defeat the General. (This quest has some really cool cutscenes in it.)<br>
<br>
<b>Difficulty Level: <font color="red">Hard</font></b><br>
<br>
Items/Skills Needed To Start: 5 coins, a good weapon and armor are a MUST. Ability to defeat a level 132 bouncer and level 112 General Khazard.<br>
<br>
Starting Location: Lady Servil, she's southeast of the gnome battlefield, the northwest edge of the arena camp.<br>
<br>
Reward: 1,000 coins, 3375 Theiving xp, and 12,175 Attack xp<br>
<br>
<b>Instructions:</b><br>
Talk to Lady Servil and agree to help her rescue her family. Head east and go into the most northeastern house, open the chest and take armor, put it on.<br>
<br>
Go just south into the prison, the guard will let you in if your wearing the armor. Talk to Jeremy through the cage. He'll tell you the guard has the keys.<br>
<br>
Go into the the southeast corner room and talk to the guard. He'll mention that Khali brew makes him sleep. Go west to the tavern and grab some. Then return and talk to him. He'll give you the keys and get drunk.<br>
<br>
Use the keys on Jeremy's door and you'll run out to the arena. Save Justin Servil from a level 55 Khazard ogre. The General will take you prisoner to fight again after you kill the ogre.<br>
<br>
Talk to Hengrad and then soon you'll be taken out to the arena to fight again. First you'll have to defeat a level 44 Khazard scorpion. Defeat it to fight the level 132, Bouncer. After you defeat them both, kill level 112 General Khazard. See step 6 for useful tips on defeating them.<br>
<br>
Bouncer can follow you anywhere in arena, so use it against him. There's a carcass on the west side of the scaffold, position yourself on one side of it and your opponent on the other, you can shoot at him without getting attacked. Maging works much better than ranging in my opinion.<br>
<br>
If you leave before you've to killed the General to get food or something, when you come back if it says you can't go in because it's locked, head to Lady Servil and your done (This happened to me). On the other hand, if you defeat them you talk to one of the Servils, than head to the Lady to claim your reward. (Congratulations)<br>
