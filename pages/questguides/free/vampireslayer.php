<br>
Description: Count Draynor is terrorizing the small village of Draynor. The townsfolk want you to kill this vampire.<br>
<br>
<b>Difficulty Level: <font color="Yellow">Medium</font></b><br>
<br>
Items/Skills Needed To Start: A hammer, decent armor and weapon, a few gp to buy some beers.<br>
<br>
Starting Location: Draynor Village<br>
<br>
Reward: 3 quest points, some attack and defense xp<br>
<br>
<b>Instructions:</b><br>
<br>
Find Morgan in Draynor. It's not that hard; it's just a small village. He'll tell you about the vampire and ask you to kill it. He'll also tell you to go find his friend Dr. Harlow at the Jolly Boar Inn.<br>
<br>
First, go upstairs and search the wall cupboard for a clove of garlic. Then go northeast of Varrock to the inn.<br>
<br>
Talk to him and get him the beer he asks for. He'll tell you how to beat it and give you a stake.<br>
<br>
Get everything you need and go to Draynor Manor. Head to the stairs that go down. Open the coffin and the Count should jump out and start attacking you.<br>
<br>
Attack him until he has a full red bar, and the stake should automatically stab him. If not, make sure you have a hammer and the stake with you. If it still doesn't work, try using garlic on him or manually stabbing him with the stake.<br>
<br>
Once he's dead, you have finished the quest. (Congratulations!)<br>
