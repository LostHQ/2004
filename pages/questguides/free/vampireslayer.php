<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<br>
<div data-progress>Find Morgan in Draynor; he has the quest symbol above his house. He'll tell you about the vampire and ask you to kill it. He'll also tell you to go find his friend, Dr. Harlow, at the Jolly Boar Inn.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Go upstairs in his house and search the west wall cupboard for a clove of garlic.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Head to Varrock and go to the Jolly Boar Inn, which is northeast outside the city walls.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Talk to Dr. Harlow and get him the beer that he asks for. He'll tell you how to defeat the vampire. He then hands you a stake to hammer it through the vampire's undead heart.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>When you are ready, make sure you have the garlic, stake, and hammer in inventory, and go to Draynor Manor. Head to the stairs that go down on the east side of the manor.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Open the coffin, and the Count should jump out and start attacking you.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Attack him until he has a full red bar, and  then use the stake on him to stab him through the heart. If not, make sure you have a hammer and the stake with you.</div>
<br><br>
Once he's dead, you have finished the quest. (Congratulations!)
