<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<br>
<div data-progress>Find Morgan in Draynor. It's not that hard; it's just a small village. He'll tell you about the vampire and ask you to kill it. He'll also tell you to go find his friend Dr. Harlow at the Jolly Boar Inn.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>First, go upstairs and search the wall cupboard for a clove of garlic. Then go northeast of Varrock to the inn.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Talk to him and get him the beer he asks for. He'll tell you how to beat it and give you a stake.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Get everything you need and go to Draynor Manor. Head to the stairs that go down. Open the coffin and the Count should jump out and start attacking you.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Attack him until he has a full red bar, and the stake should automatically stab him. If not, make sure you have a hammer and the stake with you. If it still doesn't work, try using garlic on him or manually stabbing him with the stake.</div>
<br><br>
Once he's dead, you have finished the quest. (Congratulations!)
