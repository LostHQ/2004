<b>Instructions:</b><br>
<br>
Talk to the witch Hetty, and she will tell you about getting the ingredient for the cauldron. You will need four items: an onion, burnt meat, an eye of newt, and a rat tail.<br>
<br>
An onion can be found northwest of Rimmington. When you find the place, pick one.<br>
<br>
Burnt meat: You will need either burnt rat meat or burnt bear meat. I would suggest rat meat. Just go east of the village and you will find some big rats. Kill one and get the meat. Return to the village. Go to the house north of Hetty's. Use the meat on the range. If you have cooked it successfully, use the cooked meat on the range again. You will get a burnt meat.<br>
<br>
Rat tail: Just kill one of the rats in this village, and it will drop a rat tail. You must start the quest before killing the rat.<br>
<br>
After getting the ingredients, return to Hetty's house and talk to her. She will tell you the cauldron is done and ask you to drink it. Click on the cauldron to drink it, and the quest is finished.<br>
