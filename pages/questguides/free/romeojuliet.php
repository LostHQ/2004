<br>
Description: Romeo and Juliet long to be together, but Juliet's father doesn't approve. Find a way to reunite them so they can live happily ever after.<br>
<br>
<b>Difficulty Level: <font color="Green">Easy</font></b><br>
<br>
Items/Skills Needed To Start: Cadavaberries (you can get them east of the stone circles, which are south of Varrock)<br>
<br>
Starting Location: Juliet's house, just west of Varrock on the north side of the road<br>
<br>
Reward: 5 Quest Points<br>
<br>
Talk to Juliet on her <span data-floors="US">2nd floor</span> balcony to learn about her love affair with Romeo and the complications that have set in. She asks you to take a message to Romeo in Varrock Square.<br>
<br>
Find Romeo, and he'll tell you what the letter says. He directs you to Father Lawrence in the chapel to the northeast.<br>
<br>
Father Lawrence will tell you that you need to make a special potion — a cadaver potion. He sends you to the apothecary, who can be found just south of the square and a little to the west.<br>
<br>
Assuming you have your berries, go to the apothecary and talk to him twice to receive the potion he mixes for you.<br>
<br>
Take the potion back to Juliet. She'll thank you and remind you to go inform Romeo of the plan, because he can "be quite dense sometimes."<br>
<br>
Walk back to Romeo and tell him that Juliet has the potion and that he needs to revive her from the crypt. Unfortunately, the poor fool misunderstands and thinks she is dead permanently. What a great ending — Juliet dies, and Romeo lives his life in misery.<br>
<br>
You'll get your reward after talking to Romeo. Who cares about a bad ending, as long as you get your reward, right?<br>
