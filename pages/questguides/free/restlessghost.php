<br>
<b>Difficulty Level: <font color="Green">Easy</font></b><br>

<br>
Starting Location: Lumbrige Chapel<br>
<br>
Reward: 1 quest point, prayer xp<br>
<br>
Instructions:<br>
<br>
Talk to Aerick and he'll inform you of the situation. He wants you to visit Father Urhney who is meditating in the swamps(How boring would that be?) and ask him about how to get rid of the ghost.<br>
<br>
Go north around the castle and then go west until you get to the edge of a fence, then go south of it and proceed east to the southeast corner of the swamp.<br>
<br>
Talk to Urhney and he'll give you an amulet of ghostspeak and some info on what the ghost might want.<br>
<br>

Head back to the church graveyard and talk to the ghost, he'll be surprised that you can understand him. After getting over himself, he'll tell you that a warlock stole his skull from his coffin, and took it to an island. The Wizard's Tower Island.<br>
<br>
Head over there and go into the basement. Look for a skull and take it. A skeleton will pop out, kill it or just run and grab the skull and hightail it out of there.<br>
<br>
Go back to the tomb and use the skull with the ghost's coffin. The ghost will vanish and whisper thank you. Of course a minor thank you isn't going to cut it, so of course the ghost also gives you your reward. Quest completed.<br>
