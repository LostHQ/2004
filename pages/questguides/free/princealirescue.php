<br><br>
<div data-progress>Head over towards Draynor Village, find Leela. She is located east of Draynor Village just south of the wheat field. You'll tell her you are there to help her free the prince, then she'll check what items you have and tell you what else you still need.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Find Aggie the witch, she can make you the skin paste and yellow dye.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Talk to Ned, bring him 4 balls of wool and he can make a rope. With 3 more balls of wool he can make you a wig for the disguise. Use your yellow dye on the wig.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Talk to Lady Keli, tell her you've heard of her, she's famous all over RuneScape.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Then ask her what her latest plan is, then tell her she must have been very skillful.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Then ask her if she's sure they won't let the prisoner out.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Make sure you have the soft clay here and ask her if you can see the key. Then ask her if you can touch it for a moment then you'll make an imprint of the key in the clay.</div>
<br><br>
