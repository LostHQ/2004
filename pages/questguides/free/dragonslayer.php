<br><br>
<hr>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<br>
<div data-progress>Enter the Champions Guild, southwest outside of Varrock. You will need 32 Quest Points to enter. Talk to the Champion's Guild master. Ask him about the Rune platebody, and he'll tell you about Oziach.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Go to the house between the fence and the cliff, at the northwest corner of Edgeville, and talk to Oziach.</div>
<br><br>
<img src="img/questimages/dragonslayer4.png" width="450">
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Ask him about Rune platebody, the Dragonfire Shield, and the map pieces. Be sure to exhaust every dialogue option. He should give you a key to Melzar's Maze.</div>
<br><br>
<h3>Thalzar's Map Piece</h3>
<div data-progress>From Oziach's house, head west toward Ice Mountain with your Silk, Mind Bomb, Unfired bowl, and Lobster pot. Go to the Oracle at the top of the mountain to the north. Speak to her about a map piece. She'll tell you about a door in the mines.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Head to the dwarven camp south of Ice Mountain and climb down the ladder into the mines.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Go south past the first minecarts, then east to find a door. Simply, click the door to go inside, and your quest items needed will disappear. Inside, open the chest in the center of the room and search to find a map piece. You must "click here to continue" before it can go into inventory.</div>
<br><br>
<h3>Lozar's Map Piece</h3>
<div data-progress>From the Dwarven mines, leave the room and walk south until you see stairs to the east, and go up. You are now in East Falador.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Walk to the bank and bank everything except your Mage or Range gear, 2,000 coins, some food, Melzar's Key, 3 planks, 12 nails, and a hammer. Also, bring either 10,000 coins or Telegrab runes and a Wizard's Mind Bomb if you need to boost your magic. Bring a teleport to Lumbridge if you wish.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Head to Port Sarim, south of Falador. Enter the jail south of the food shop and find a goblin named Wormbrain.</div>
<br><br>
<img src="img/questimages/dragonslayer5.png">
<br><br>
<div data-progress>If using Telegrab, kill him through the bars and telegrab the map piece that he drops. If you don't have at least 33 Magic after boosts, you will have to talk to him and pay him 10,000 coins.</div>
<br><br>
<h3>Repairing Lady Lumbridge</h3>
<div data-progress>While you are here, go to the southern dock of Port Sarim and speak to Klarense, who owns Lady Lumbridge, but ask if he is willing to sell it. Pay him 2k gold for the ship.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Cross the plank to board the ship and climb the ladder to go below deck.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Look just south of the ladder to find the hole. Use your planks on the hole to repair it. Each plank will take 4 nails.</div>
<br><br>
<h3>Melzar's Map Piece</h3>
<div data-progress>Head to Melzar's Maze, which is between the Crafting Guild and Rimmington, and use your key on the door.</div>
<br><br>
<img src="img/questimages/dragonslayer6.png" width="450">
<br><br>
Inside, you will see multiple colored doors leading to ladders. You must go through the right sequence of doors to get to the end of the maze. Getting through the door is based on the monsters in the room.
<br><br>
NOTE: Only one specific monster in the room will always give you a key, while the others are just distractions. So, when looking for keys, DO NOT kill one spawn over and over.
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Kill giant rats until one drops a red key. Use it on the northwest door, then go up the ladder.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Kill ghosts until one drops an orange key. There are four doors on the Eastern side. In the picture below, the 3 north-eastern doors are visible. Go in the middle one, to the right of the bookshelf.</div>
<br><br>
<img src="img/questimages/dragonslayer7.png" width="450">
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Kill skeletons until you get a yellow key. Use it on the most southwestern door. Follow the corridor and go down the 3 ladders to the basement until you reach zombies.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Kill zombies until one drops a blue key. Use it on the northwest door.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Kill Melzar the Mad until he drops a magenta key. Use it on the north door to proceed.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>You will now face a lesser demon to obtain your final key. The lesser demon can be safespotted standing near the magenta door you just came through. Kill the Lesser Demon to get the green key. Use the key on the door.</div>
<br><br>
<img src="img/questimages/dragonslayer3.png" width="450">
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Open and search the chest to get the last map piece. You must "click here to continue" before it can go into inventory. Use all map pieces on each other to form the full map.</div>
<br><br>
<h3>The Fight with Elvarg</h3>
<div data-progress>If you brought your runes to teleport to Lumbridge, teleport to Lumbridge. Otherwise, make your way to Lumbridge. Once at Lumbridge, go into Lumbridge Castle and go up the northern stairs once, and enter the Duke's room.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Talk to the Duke. Ask about a shield to protect against dragons. He'll give you the Dragonfire Shield. It's advised to drop it, get another, and pick up the first one â€” just in case you die later. You can get as many as you like.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Go to Draynor Village, just west of Lumbridge.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>In Draynor, find Ned, who is wearing all blue, either in the house just south of the quest symbol on the map or wandering outside. Talk to him. He mentions he is a sailor, so ask him to sail you to Crandor.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Right-click to use the map on Ned. He'll tell you to meet him at the ship.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Head to the bank to prepare for the boss fight. Bring an Attack & Strength potion, food, emergency teleport (Ring of Dueling is a cheap option, must be unequipped to rub), armor, weapons, and most importantly, your Dragonfire Shield. This boss CANNOT be safe-spotted.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Head to your ship, Lady Lumbridge, go below deck, and talk to Ned. Off to Crandor!</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>After arriving, the ship will be damaged. Disembark and climb the hill. Follow the map below to reach the center of Crandor, avoiding the King Scorpions and Lesser Demons. Once you reach the top, enter the dungeon.</div>
<br><br>
<img src="img/questimages/dragonslayer2.png">
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Inside, dodge the skeletons and walk deeper into the cave. Head south toward the Lesser Demons and look for a "secret" wall with an "Open" command. Your character will memorize this location for future access.</div>
<br><br>
Here is a picture of the wall:
<br>
<img src="img/questimages/dragonslayer1.png" width="450">
<br><br>
NOTE: If you die during your fight with Elvarg and have unlocked this secret door, you do not need to repair Lady Lumbridge again. Take a boat to Musa Point and go to the Volcano. There is a rope into the Volcano, then the secret door is just north of the spiders. You can now try to defeat Elvarg again.
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Re-enter the secret wall and go back north to the East door. Get ready to fight Elvarg, a level 86 green dragon. Drink your Attack and Strength potions, make sure your Dragonfire Shield is equipped, and enter the door.</div>
<br><br>
Protip: Elvarg's max hit if you are wearing the Dragonfire shield is 10. So be sure you eat enough to be above 10 hitpoints at all times. If using melee, best to be on Accurate to hit more often. You can switch to Aggressive to hit harder, but you may not land a hit as often.
<br><br>
<div data-progress>After defeating Elvarg, you'll be teleported outside. Congratulations â€” you've completed Dragon Slayer! Go buy that Rune platebody, you legend.</div>
<br><br>
<h3>Finishing Up</h3>
<div data-progress>If a skeleton attacks you, don't panic. From here, either use your emergency teleport or go through the secret door again just south. Go east to find a rope and climb up.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>You are now at the top of Karamja Volcano. Make your way to the dock and leave Karamja. If you cannot afford to pay the toll, pick 10 bananas to fill the crate for Luthas near the dock to get 30gp to afford a trip to Port Sarim.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Speak to Oziach and tell him the dragon is dead. You can now wear a Rune Platebody and Green Dragonhide body!</div>
