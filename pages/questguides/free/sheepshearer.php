<div data-progress>Talk to Fred the Farmer, who is located north of Lumbridge in the little building by all the sheep. Tell him that you are in search of a quest. He'll respond by saying his sheep need to be sheared and will reward you if you bring back 20 balls of wool.</div>

<div data-progress>Once you've got 20 wool, go to Lumbridge Castle and head to the <span data-floors="US">2nd floor</span>, where you'll find a spinning wheel in the middle room. Use all your wool on it, and you should have 20 balls of wool.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Return to Fred with your 20 balls of wool and give them to him. He'll thank you and reward you for your help. You'll receive 1 Quest point, 60 gold coins, and 150 Crafting XP.</div>
