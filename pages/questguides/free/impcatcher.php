<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<br>
<div data-progress>Talk to Wizard Mizgog. He will tell you that he has lost his beads — red, white, black, and yellow. He will also tell you that Wizard Grayzag's imp stole the beads. Tell him that you will return them.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>You can find some imps near the room where you are. Kill them to get the beads. Be patient — imps don't usually drop them. If you don't want to kill imps, don't worry — you can also buy the beads from other players. That will save you a lot of time.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>After you have collected all the beads, return to Wizard Mizgog. He will reward you.</div>
