<b>Instructions:</b><br>
<br>
1. First, talk to Doric, who is located northwest of Falador. He'll tell you that to use his anvils, he needs 6 Clay, 4 Copper ore, and 2 Iron ore.<br>
<br>
2. If you already have a pickaxe, skip this step. If you don't, walk over to Barbarian Village. In one of the buildings, you'll find a Bronze pickaxe on a table. Pick it up.<br>
<br>
3. With your pickaxe in hand, head to the northern entrance of the Dwarven Mines, which is located northeast of Falador.<br>
<br>
4. Once there, go down the trapdoor and head south until you see some iron and copper rocks. Mine 2 Iron ore and 4 Copper ore from them. Then go a little farther south to find some clay rocks, and mine 6 Clay.<br>
<br>
5. Now that you have 6 Clay, 4 Copper ore, and 2 Iron ore in your inventory, return to Doric and give him the ores. He'll appreciate it very much and reward you with 1 Quest Point, 180 coins, and 1,300 Mining XP.<br>
<br>
6. Congratulations! You've just completed Doric's Quest and can now use his anvils.<br>
