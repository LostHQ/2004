<br>
Instructions:<br>
<br>
1. Talk to the Gypsy in her tent and pay her a coin to reveal the future to you. She'll do her thing and tell you that Delrith has been released. She also says that you're the only one that can stop him. She goes on into some history of Delrith, then tells you to see Sir Prysin in Varrock castle. Make sure you ask what the magical incantation is. You don't need to write it down if you're using the guide (of course).<br>
<br>

2. Sir Prysin is in the south west side of the castle. Ask him about Silverlight and find out he needs 3 keys to unlock the chest containing Silverlight. He'll tell you to talk to Captain Rovin on an upper floor of the castle.<br>
<br>

3. Go upstairs and find the Captain and talk until he gives you his key.<br>
<br>

4. Sir Prysin dropped a key down the drain also (what a klutz), so head to the most north east room and go upstairs, grab a bucket, go back down and fill it from the sink.<br>
<br>

5. Use the bucket of water with the drain then hurry down into the sewers through the manhole, go a little ways in and you should find the key in no time.<br>

<br>
6. Get your collect your 25 bones and head to the wizard towers. Talk to the Wizard Traiborn to get your 3rd key after some bumblings about dum stuff.<br>
<br>

7. Go back to Sir Prysin with all 3 keys and you get Silverlight from him at long last.<br>
<br>

8. Head out the south gate of Varrock to the dark wizard's stone circle. Wield Silverlight and charge at Delrith full force. Fight him until he has full red bar. They'll be a cool animation of him half sucked in the vortex from where he came.<br>
<br>

9. Choose "Carlem Aber Camerinthum Purchai Gabindo" to get the demon vanquished. If you choose the wrong one, you must fight Delrith again, and possibly repeat until you get the right one.<br>
<br>

10. Once he's gone (Congratuations) your done and you get the reward.<br>
