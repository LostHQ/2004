# LostHQ

LostHQ is an informational hub for [LostCity.RS](https://2004.lostcity.rs/), built in the style of the classic **RuneHQ**.  
Its goal is to provide players with an easy-to-navigate resource for quests, skills, and game mechanics â€” tailored specifically for the LostCity private server.  

LostHQ organizes content by **year** (2004, 2005, etc.), allowing players to explore information as it was relevant to the era they're most interested in. This makes it especially useful for those who want to experience LostCity in a way that closely mirrors RuneScape's historical development.

All credits for resources, design inspiration, and data sourcing are already provided on the website itself.  

LostHQ is not affiliated with Jagex, RuneHQ, or Old School RuneScape. It is a fan-made project created to support the LostCity community.
